\section*{Extended Abstract}

A big part of software written in Haskell is hosted on hackage HACKAGEREFERENCE. This software is organized and distributed as cabal packages CABALREFERENCE. The contribution of this paper is an analysis of a part of the packages on hackage regarding API evolution and API usage.

A package is identified by a package name for example "text". It groups related functionality for example for text processing. Given a repository of available package versions a package might have one or more versions.

A package version is identified by a package and a version number for example "text-0.11.2.3". Version numbers are ordered and as a package evolves package versions with increasing version numbers are uploaded to hackage.

Depending on the platform and available non-haskell dependencies a single package version might need to have different variants.

Every variant again given a repository of available package versions gives rise to several instances.

An instance defines modules.

A module contains declarations.

A declaration defines symbols some of which are exported. The exported symbols are the interface of the module.

Now what's new:

Declarations differ across all three dimensions version, variant and instance because of stuff. But how much?

BTW how come people assume that stuff can still be used if the interface is the same even though the implementation has changed?

Do people adhere to PVP?

Is the PVP annoying because it prevents stuff from being built that could be built? (cite BOS)
